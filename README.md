# TransportSimulation

@author: Christian Frey; Oct. 2020

This repository implements the "Little Simulation in C++" task. 
The scenario is a little transport simulation with various types of vehicles on a 2D Plane. 

Currently the simulation implements three different types of vehicles: 
* Private Car
* Taxi
* Bus

## Settings:
All settings provided in the description of the tasks can be changed in the header file _constants.h_. 
For a detailed output on each time step one might set _VERBOSE_ in the constants file to *1*. 
Per default, there is a summary of a vehicle's stats whenever an agent (Vehicle) is out of boundary (and therefore is no longer part of the simulation) and when the simulation ends there is a summary of the vehicles overall performance. 

## Usage
make file to come...
